### Description

This is a sample on how to make a server accept multiple conections using an array of winsock controls (6.0 SP5). Well, not much more to say, just that I saw some others that arent as well coded :P

It does only work with version 6.0 and SP5 of the control (and above? :]) since there was a bug in SP4 so that you couldn't unload the control...
